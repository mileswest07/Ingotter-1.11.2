# Ingotter

Adds various types of ores, ingots, plates and dusts!
Ingotter is made for modpack makers to unite all their ingots, ores, dusts, plates and more into one mod
instead of using a lot of other mods!
Almost everything is configurable in config files, from Y level of ores to how much ores can spawn in a chunk.
Ingotter has in game config so you don't need to exit game to test ore spawn, but if you're changing ore generation in already
created world you have to go approximately 1000 blocks away for new chunks to spawn.
 
**Planned Features**
- Armors and Tools
- Wire Cutters for wires
 
Feel free to request features and use the mod in modpacks!
